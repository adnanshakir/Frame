# Frame

Frame is a minimal, Figma-style visual editor built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate core editor concepts such as **DOM manipulation, mouse interactions, state management, and persistence**, without using canvas, SVG, or external frameworks.

## Features
- Create rectangles and text elements
- Single-element selection with resize handles
- Drag, resize, and rotate elements within canvas bounds
- Layers panel with z-index control
- Properties panel for live editing
- Keyboard shortcuts (move, delete)
- Save & load layout using `localStorage`
- Export design as JSON or basic HTML

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

This project focuses on **correctness, clarity, and clean logic** rather than visual complexity.
